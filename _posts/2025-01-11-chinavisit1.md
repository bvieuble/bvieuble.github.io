## Invited by peers in China? You are at the good place!

You are a senior or young researcher and have been invited by a peer to give a 
talk at a Chinese institute or university, to give a class, to attend a 
conference or a workshop? You wish to accept but wonder if you need to apply 
for a visa? And if so, what documents you need for the application? How to 
organize your trip? What you should know before going? How will you sustain 
yourself when you're there? Say no more, you are in the right place!

First things first, if you are dealing with a renowned Chinese academic 
institute, you can sit back and relax, you are in good hands! They know their 
business, you are not the first foreigner they invite and you won't be the 
last. Your Chinese peers will take it to heart to provide you with the best and
smoothest experience. In all fairness, you'll likely be provided with more 
accurate instructions and information than this simple guide. Yet, as I was
once in your exact situation, I might still be able to provide you with some 
good tips.

If you wish to keep up with me, we will cover three main topics which should
help you get the best experience possible out of your academic visit in China. 
The first part of my guide, which you are now reading,
covers your right of entry into mainland China. This 
includes your eligibility for visa exemption and, if not eligible, the 
procedure to apply for a visa for the purpose of an academic visit. If you are
already up-to-date on visa matters, you can go check out the next parts of the
guide listed in [Continue the Guide](#continue-the-guide) and print your [TODO
list](https://bvieuble.me/blog/2025/chinavisit4).

## Visa or not visa?

Ultimately, if you read this post, you are likely NOT to hold a Chinese
passport or a Chinese residence permit. Hence, you need to carefully check the
rules that apply to you to enter mainland China. Regulations in the matter have
highly fluctuated these last few years, most often in the direction of leveraging or simplifying the requirements. Hence, at the time you read this post, certain information I present might be incomplete or wrong. I therefore strongly recommend checking the regulations presented on the official websites of your government or the websites of the Chinese embassies, consulates, or visa application centers in your country.

### Visa exemption

As of today, if you hold a passport from certain countries in the European Union, East 
Asia, Oceania, and more, chances are that you are exempt from holding a visa 
for academic exchange for a duration of less than 30 days. This would give you
more than enough time to attend most workshops, conferences, or seminars. The most 
reliable way to know if you are eligible for such an exemption is to check the
travel information provided by your government or the Chinese embassies in your
home country. You can also check the [Travel 
China](https://travelchina.guide/visa/free) website which lists the visa-exempt
countries, or find some official information on the [Chinese 
government](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/wjbzwfwpt/kzx/tzgg/202411/t20241130_11535783.html) website.

Be careful, being exempt from holding a visa does not mean you can arrive at 
the border unprepared. You need to be ready to provide the border agent with 
some proof of the purpose of your visit if asked. In the case of a short academic 
visit, it falls down to the following documents:
  - A **valid passport** (I mean...).
  - An **invitation letter** from your academic host in China. The letter 
    should be addressed to you and should provide basic information, such as a 
    short description of the activities you will engage in, the dates of your 
    visit to the host institution, the host's contact information, etc.
  - Reservation of **airplane tickets**, especially the flight out of China
    proving that you are scheduled to leave the Chinese territory.
  - Reservations of **accommodation** (e.g., hotel reservations). If you are 
    not staying in a hotel, the official recommendations I could 
    find are slightly vague. If your academic host provides you with other form 
    of accommodation (e.g., the University owns flats dedicated to host 
    visitors and staffs), I think the host should mention it on the invitation letter 
    and maybe provide you with a filled 
    [invitation form](https://bio.visaforchina.cn/MAC3_EN/qianzhengyewu/jichuzhishi/changjianwenti/230221174293008384.html).
    <!-- with another document certifying that they are providing you  -->
    <!-- with an accommodation.  -->
  If you stay at a 
    relative or friend's place, ask them to fill an 
    [invitation form](https://bio.visaforchina.cn/MAC3_EN/qianzhengyewu/jichuzhishi/changjianwenti/230221174293008384.html) which
    contains various information including dates of stay, address, and Chinese
    ID number. Beware that if you
    are not staying in a hotel, you will have to register at the police station
    within 24 hours; more is said about this in section [Hotel](https://bvieuble.me/blog/2025/chinavisit3/#hotel).

It is strongly recommended that you have everything printed and ready to be presented at
the border. Note that you may not be asked to show all these 
documents; this is up to the judgment of the border agent.
If you wish, you can also complete this list with other documents that might 
serve as proof that you have an on-going working contract as an academic
or a researcher outside of China, that you are covered by a travel insurance,
that you have enough money to sustain yourself, etc. You will most likely not
be asked to provide one of these, yet, if this is not too inconvenient to 
obtain, it certainly won't hurt.


> ##### ⚠️ The PhD student case
>
> Beware that a visa exemption does not cover entrance to mainland China for the purpose of work, journalism, and **STUDY**. In particular, in China, a PhD student is fully considered a "student". Hence, if you are a PhD student, it should be clarified with your host institution or organism in China if your visit falls within the "study" or "exchange" classification. With the first, you are provided with an admission notice or letter that you should use to apply for a study visa. With the second, you should be provided with an invitation letter and, depending on your nationality, can be exempt from holding a visa.

### If you need a visa

There are different kinds of visas you can apply for to enter mainland China, and all have different requirements. The type of visa you need depends on the purpose and length of your visit. If you are coming to China for a short academic trip (e.g., invited to give a talk at a seminar, visiting a scholar for collaboration, attending conferences or workshops, etc.), you likely need an F visa. You can find more detailed information about F visa on [Travel China Guide](https://www.travelchinaguide.com/embassy/visa/f-visa.htm) for instance. In addition, a step-by-step visa application guide can be found on [Travel China](https://travelchina.guide/visa/application).

In short, you should be asked to provide the following documents to apply for an F visa:
  - **Passport** with two blank visa pages, plus a photocopy of the passport's bio page.
  - A **Visa Application Form** which has to be filled out online on the [Chinese visa Application Center](https://bio.visaforchina.cn/) website and which should be printed and signed. Note that you must pick the country/city where you wish to apply for the visa at this step.
  - Passport-sized **photo** in color and with a white background.
  - An **official invitation letter** from your host. A scanned and printed version of the letter is generally acceptable. Sometimes, the invitation mentions the city where you must apply for the visa. For this reason, let your host know early in which city you would like to submit your application. 
  - A proof of legal residence if you are applying in a country other than your home country (e.g., a visa or residence permit).

Once you have filled and validated the application on the [Chinese visa 
Application Center](https://bio.visaforchina.cn/) website, you must bring all 
the required documents to the visa application center of the city of your 
choice. From my understanding, appointments are no longer required in many visa
centers, and you can visit the center during working hours to submit the 
application at the time of your convenience. You will also have to pay the visa
fee at the center while applying.

Again, this is a very important business and you don't want to mess it up, so 
don't take my words for granted and check carefully the requirements that apply
to you on the [Chinese visa Application Center](https://bio.visaforchina.cn/) 
website. After you have entered your country and city of application on the 
aforementioned website, you can go to the *Visa Category* link to learn more 
about the requirements and documents you need to prepare.

To cross the border you imperatively need to hold a valid visa for the period
of your academic visit. Pay attention to the number of entries you need
while applying for the visa and the number of entries that have been granted
once the visa is issued. In particular, any trip to Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan
is an exit from mainland China. Hence, if you take a day break in Hong Kong 
while in Shenzhen for a conference, you won't be able to go back under a
single-entry visa!

Note also that in addition of your passport and
visa, while at the immigration desk, you may be asked to provide the 
documents listed in 
[Visa exemption](#visa-exemption).
