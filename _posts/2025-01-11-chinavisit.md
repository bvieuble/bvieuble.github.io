In preparation. Coming soon ;)

<!-- You are a senior or young researcher and have been invited by a peer to give a -->
<!-- talk in a Chinese institutes or universities, to give a class, to attend a -->
<!-- conference or a workshop? You wish to accept but wonder if you need to apply  -->
<!-- for a visa? And if so, what documents you need for the application? How to  -->
<!-- organize your trip? What you should know before going? How will you sustain  -->
<!-- yourself when you're there? Say no more, you are at the right place! -->
<!---->
<!-- First things first, if you are dealing with a renowned Chinese academic -->
<!-- institutes, you can sit back and relax, you are in good hands! They know their -->
<!-- business, you are not the first foreigner they invite and you won't be the  -->
<!-- last. Your Chinese peers will take it to heart to provide you with the best and -->
<!-- smoothest experience. In all fairness, you'll likely be provided with more -->
<!-- accurate instructions and information than this simple blog post. Yet, as I was -->
<!-- once in your exact situation, I might still be able to provide you with some  -->
<!-- good tips. -->
<!---->
<!-- ## Visa or not visa? -->
<!---->
<!-- Ultimately, if you read this post, you are likely not to hold a Chinese -->
<!-- passport or a Chinese residence permit. Hence, you need to check carefully what -->
<!-- are the rules that applied to you to enter the Chinese territory. -->

<!-- ## Arrival at the airport and immigration -->
<!---->
<!-- First time in China, you'll need to get your fingerprints done at one of the -->
<!-- counters in the airport at arrival. You cannot miss it, this is generally -->
<!-- located just before the immigration. -->
<!---->
<!-- youll also need to fill the yellow ticket distributed in the plane, or if not, -->
<!-- at the airport arrival. They'll ask you basic information such as: name, -->
<!-- passport number, visa number, or reason of stay. You'll have to present it  -->
<!---->
<!-- Tips, have a pen ready in your bag to fill the form, or might need to queue to -->
<!-- use the few and spare pens at the airport. -->

<!-- Ces frais, qui peuvent être très élevés, ne pourront en aucun cas être pris en charge par l’ambassade ou les consulats généraux de France sur place. Faute de pouvoir justifier d’une couverture sociale, le voyageur s’expose au risque de ne pas avoir accès aux soins, y compris en cas d’urgence vitale. -->

<!-- Il est également rappelé que l’usage, la détention et le trafic de stupéfiants de quelque nature que ce soit (cannabis inclus) sont sévèrement réprimés en Chine. La tolérance zéro est strictement appliquée. -->
