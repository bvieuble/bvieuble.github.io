**NEW BLOG POST!!!** It's called "Coming to live in China, trash your cloud 
services and get yourself a NAS!". Because many Western cloud storage services 
do not operate in China, I explain how you can easily replace 
those services with a self-hosted NAS. It is the first post of my series 
"China life", where I share some tips to fellow expats coming to live in 
China. Don't hesitate to check it out [here](https://bvieuble.me/blog/2025/china-life-1/).
