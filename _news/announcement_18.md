Extremely happy and grateful to have been able to organize and host the
CAS-ANLA workshop with my supervisor [Prof. Xin Liu](https://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~liuxin/).
The workshop featured a total of 14 plenaries on the topic of approximate
computing, numerical linear algebra, numerical optimization, and machine
learning. You can check out the talks on the [website of the event](https://bvieuble.me/casanla/).
We hope our speakers and attendants enjoyed the event as much as we did!
