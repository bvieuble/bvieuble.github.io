 I am delighted to organize with 
 [Prof. Xin Liu](https://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~liuxin/) and 
 [Dr. Xiaobo Liu](https://xiaobo-liu.github.io/) the minisymposium 
 “Approximations and errors in Krylov-based solvers” for the ILAS 2025 
 conference in Kaohsiung (Taiwan) this year. Many thanks to our speakers for
 their participation that made this minisymposium a success.
