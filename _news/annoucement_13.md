Many thanks to [Eda Oktay](https://sites.google.com/view/eda-oktay) and Petr 
Vacek for the invitation to talk in their minisymposium "Approximate Computing 
Techniques in Numerical Linear Algebra" hosted by the SIAM LA24 conference.
My talk was entitled "A backward error analysis framework for GMRES", the 
slides are available [here](assets/pdf/p_siamla24.pdf).
