Many thanks to [Théo Mary](https://tmary.perso.lip6.fr/), 
[Alfredo Buttari](https://abuttari.gitlab.io/), and
[Fabienne Jezequel](https://www-pequan.lip6.fr/~jezequel/) for their invitation
to speak at the Workshop on Approximate Computing in Numerical Linear
Algebra hosted by Sorbonne University (Paris, France). My talk was entitled
"Mixed precision strategies for preconditioned GMRES".
