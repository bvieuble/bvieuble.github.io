 I have been invited to give a lecture to postgrad students at Université Paris-Saclay. The presentation title was “On improving the refinement of inaccurate linear solvers”. You can find the slides [here](/assets/pdf/l_saclay_master_hpc_v2026.pdf). Thank you [Oguz](https://kayaogz.github.io/) and [Pablo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BzGqO6EAAAAJ) for the invitation!
