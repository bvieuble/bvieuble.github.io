**CALL FOR PARTICIPATION at JULIACON and ABSTRACT SUBMISSION:**

<br>
<br>

[Jonas Schulze](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/person/123983) and I are 
organizing a minisymposium on Approximate Computing in Numerical Linear Algebra
which will be held during JuliaCon, August 10-15, in Mainz, Germany.

<br>
<br>

The main purpose of this minisymposium is to provide a space where people can
share and talk about the newest Julia software developments in approximate 
computing for numerical linear algebra (and beyond). We wish to promote Julia 
as a tool for driving advancements in approximate computing and highlight the 
latest exciting Julia packages in this field. Lastly, we would like to end the 
minisymposium with a panel discussion around the development of an approximate
computing ecosystem in Julia.

Registration is required for participation. More info on...
