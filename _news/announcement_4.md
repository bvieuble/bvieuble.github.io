The SIAM-IMA student chapter conference in which I am part of the organizing
committee has been held successfully. Ten talks from students and invited
speakers were spread on one full-day. You can find the full program on the
website [here](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~siam/msiscc23/). Congrats to
the SIAM student chapter of the University of Manchester for the hard work!
