I am extremely grateful to have been awarded the International Scientists 
Project Fund of BJNSF (Beijing Natural Science Foundation) for my project
entitled “On improving the refinement of inaccurate linear solvers for the 
solution of real-life large-scale problems”. Additionally, I wish to thanks
[Prof. Xin Liu](https://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~liuxin/) for accepting to be a member of
this project.
