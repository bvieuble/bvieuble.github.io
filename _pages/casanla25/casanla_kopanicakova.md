<h3 style="text-align: left;font-size:26px !important;">Towards trustworthy use of scientific machine-learning in large scale numerical simulations</h3>
{:data-toc-text="Alena Kopanicakova"}

Recently, scientific machine learning (SciML) has expanded the capabilities of 
traditional numerical approaches by simplifying computational modeling and 
providing cost-effective surrogates. However, SciML models suffer from the 
absence of explicit error control, a computationally intensive training phase,
and a lack of reliability in practice.  In this talk, we will take the first 
steps toward addressing these challenges by exploring two different research
directions. Firstly, we will demonstrate how the use of advanced numerical
methods, such as multilevel and domain-decomposition solution strategies, can
contribute to efficient training and produce more accurate SciML models.
Secondly, we propose to hybridize SciML models with state-of-the-art numerical
solution strategies. This approach will allow us to take advantage of the 
accuracy and reliability of standard numerical methods while harnessing the
efficiency of SciML. The effectiveness of the proposed training and
hybridization strategies will be demonstrated by means of several numerical 
experiments, encompassing the training of DeepONets and the solving of linear
systems of equations that arise from the high-fidelity discretization of linear
parametric PDEs using DeepONet-enhanced multilevel and domain-decomposition 
methods.
