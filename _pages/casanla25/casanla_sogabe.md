<h3 id="sogabe" style="text-align: right;font-size:26px !important;">Recent Developments in Krylov Subspace Methods for Nonsymmetric Shifted Linear Systems</h3>
{:data-toc-text="Tomohiro Sogabe"}

Shifted linear systems of the form $$(A+ s_{k} I)x_{k}=b$$ for $$k=1,2,\dots, n$$ 
frequently arise in quantum chromodynamics and  large-scale electronic
structure calculations. These linear systems also appear in  subproblems of 
eigenvalue problems and matrix function computations.
In this talk, we briefly review Krylov subspace methods for solving 
nonsymmetric linear systems, along with our recent solver that  is joint work 
with R. Zhao.
