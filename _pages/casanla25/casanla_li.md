{:data-toc-text="Qingna Li"}

We consider the fast optimization algorithm for optimal viscosities in damping 
system. Different from standard models that  minimize the trace of the solution
of parameterized Lyapunov equation, the nonnegative constraints for viscosities 
are added in the optimization model, which hasn't been considered before. To
solve the new model, an efficient  algorithm is then proposed, aiming at 
reducing the residuals of the corresponding KKT conditions. By combining with 
the Barzilai-Borwein  stepsize, the proposed BB residual minimization algorithm 
(short for BBRMA) can further speed up to deal with large scale linear 
vibration systems. Extensive numerical results verify the high efficiency of
the proposed algorithm. This is the joint work with Fran√ßoise Tisseur.
