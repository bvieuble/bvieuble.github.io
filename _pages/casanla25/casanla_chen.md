{:data-toc-text="Xinye Chen"}

Hierarchical matrix computations have attracted significant attention in the 
science and engineering community as exploiting  data-sparse structures can 
significantly reduce the computational complexity of many important kernels. 
One particularly popular option within this class is the Hierarchical 
Off-Diagonal Low-Rank (HODLR) format. This talk demonstrates that off-diagonal 
low-rank blocks in HODLR matrices can be stored in reduced precision without
degrading overall accuracy. An adaptive-precision scheme ensures numerical 
stability in key computations. We provide theoretical insights to guide
precision selection, with experiments confirming effectiveness. An emulation 
software that facilitates the research on HODLR matrix computations is also 
presented.
