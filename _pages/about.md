I received an M.Sc. in applied mathematics and computer science from 
[ENSEEIHT](https://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/index.html) (french engineering school) 
in September 2019.

I completed my Ph.D. thesis (Sep 2019 - Nov 2022) in the 
[APO](https://www.irit.fr/en/departement/dep-hpc-simulation-optimization/apo-team/) team
at Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse 
([IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/)) under the supervision of 
[Alfredo Buttari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sLuYk0wAAAAJ&hl=en)
and [Th√©o Mary](https://www-pequan.lip6.fr/~tmary/). 

I was a Research Associate in the 
[Numerical Linear Algebra Group](https://nla-group.org/) of the
[University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) working with 
[Professor Nicholas J. Higham](https://nhigham.com/). 

I am now working at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing under the 
supervision of [Professor Xin Liu](http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~liuxin/).

I have strong ties with [MUMPS Technologies](https://mumps-tech.com/) with
whom I collaborated and will continue to collaborate on the improvement of the 
the MUMPS sparse direct solver.

My research interests cover various topics related to linear algebra, mixed
precision, approximate computing, sparse direct and iterative linear solvers,
and high performance computing.
